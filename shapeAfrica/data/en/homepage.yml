  title : "About Us"
  description : " We are building an all-inclusive community of Impact-driven, thoughtful, deliberate, solution and result- oriented African youths."
  content : "We believe Africa is ready to become the new world order, with a burgeoning young population, huge technology adoption rate, increased literacy levels,
   and a strong resolve for better living standards, this might be the convergence point in the history of Africa.
  There is an increasing rise of a modern army of well educated and forward-thinking professionals who are tired of the status quo and are deliberate about building innovative and robust solutions for African challenges.
   Some of the best ideas in the world today came from just sincere discussion about creative ways to solve problems among friends or colleagues,
   And our goal is to foster such a community where your thinking will be stimulated while exposing you to mental models and innovative thinking systems that will let us reshape our continent's future."

  content : "
##### **African Led**. We are a team of young African professionals working globally seeking for new ways to encourage more involved participation in the shaping of our continent’s future.
  There is a saying “He who wears the shoe knows where it hurts the most”, as africans we have firsthand experience and knowledge of the problems and challenges faced daily,
  making us the most qualified people to proffer a solution and thereby recreating our narrative.


  ##### **African Focused**. All our programs are Africa specific and focused as we believe the best people to solve our problems, would be us.
   We encourage young people to come up with community driven solutions to issue within their environments,
   everyone is encouraged to intentionally look around your community and begin to think about creative new ways to solve daily challenges.
  New programs will be announced as we go by on how we can support and encourage participation.


  ##### **African Dependent**.  Our continent is in need of men and women who are willing to stand up to injustice, corruption, insecurity, poverty, inequality, economic hardship, irresponsible policy and bad healthcare.
Africa is in need of bold leadership, innovators, social activism, entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers, infrastructure, private and public partnerships,
quality healthcare and Education. Africa depends on Africans.
We need more builders for Africa.
